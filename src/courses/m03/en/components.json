When doing so, start with the end in mind – think about what sort of academic, scholar or worker you want to be. These answers then inform the rest of your decisions. The following are some key factors to take into account when considering what you could communicate or publish:</p><ul><li>Writing up the work – from log books to (journal) manuscript.</li><li>Research topic – the overall topic or field of research the work fits within. Could you write about your broader field as a blog?</li><li>Journal selection – take into account various factors such as topic, potential for impact, manuscript length and significance to the field.</li><li>Submission/Review – journal requirements, but also what review process might be necessary for a blog or other social or new media post.</li><li>Revision – what your response will be regarding revisions (or other comments received), if any.</li><li>Publication – what you might do once the article is published. For journal articles this might mean emailing co-authors and/or other researchers referenced in the work. The same is also true for blogs. You might choose to send out a tweet or post information on Facebook or Instagram using relevant hashtags or @ mentions.</li></ul>",
